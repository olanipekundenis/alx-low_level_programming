This project is done in fulfilment of the ALX SWE basic 9 month program

Though this project seems fairly completed, their is still a lot of work
to be done on my part later on in cognissance to the project 

To run this project:

This majorly was developed using a linux OS, so I would'nt know how its 
going to perform using other OSes such as windows or ios etc

Firstly ensure you install SDL2 before running this program and see to it
that its well installed

One can run the maze with the command below:
./maze MAP

Appreciation to  Steve and Bayou for their help
